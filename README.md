## Steps to Download the Release APK ##

1. Open your Flutter project in Android Studio or Visual Studio Code.

2. Make sure your app is running correctly in debug mode by running the following command in the terminal: flutter run

3. Once your app is running successfully in debug mode, you can generate a release build of your app by running the following command in the terminal: flutter build apk

4. This will generate an APK file of your app in the "build/app/outputs/apk/release/" directory of your Flutter project. You can find the  APK file with the name "app-release.apk".
